# FT_PRINTF
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. It's a recode of printf(). It's the first encounter with **variadic functions** in C, used to make functions with variable number of arguments. 

* [**Mandatory Part**](#Mandatory-Part) - Recode **printf()** function from **libc** with "**cspdiuxX%**" flags.
* [**Bonus Part**](#Bonus-Part) - Manage any combination of the flags "**-0.**" and the field minimum width under all conversions and all the "**# +**" flags (one of them is a space).
* [**How to Use**](#How-to-Use) - How to use and compile with the project's static library.
* [**References**](#References) - References to understand and learn more about the project.
